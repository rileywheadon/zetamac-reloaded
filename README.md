# zetamac-reloaded

This is an updated version of [Zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/) which allows you to save scores to a local and global leaderboard. It is written in [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/). The first prototype of this project (August 2024) was too slow. Hopefully I'll find the time to rewrite the backend and get it up and running again.
